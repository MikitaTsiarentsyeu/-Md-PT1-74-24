The  February  TIOBE  Index  of the most
popularprogramming   languages  is  out,
andwhile   the  work  going  on  in  the
backgroundof    TIOBE  calculations  has
changed,not  much  has  shifted  in  the
wayof    rankings.
Python  continues  to
sitatop  the  index,  with  C  and  Java
directlybehind  it.  In Feb. 2021, those
threealso  occupied  the  top  spot, but
withPython    in    the    number  three
position,C  at  top,  and Java in second
place.
Beyondthe    top    three,  there
hasn’tbeen    much   movement  in  the
index,with    positions    four  through
eightunchanged  from  the same time last
year.Those     slots    are    occupied,
respectively,by  C++,  C#, Visual Basic,
JavaScriptand  PHP.  Positions  nine and
10swapped  from  Feb.  21  to  now, with
AssemblyLanguage  and  SQL now occupying
eachother's    positions.
The   one  big
moveof  note  between Feb. 2021 and Feb.
2022was   with  the  Groovy  programming
language,an    object-oriented  language
forJava.  Over  the  course of the year,
Groovyfell  from  12th  position all the
wayto    20th,   putting  it  perilously
closeto     the    "other    programming
languages"list.
TIOBE  CEO  Paul  Jansen
attributesGroovy's    decline    to  the
growthin  the  CI/CD  space.  Groovy was
theonly    language   used  for  writing
scriptson    Jenkins,    which    Jansen
describesas  having  been "the only real
playerin  the  CI/CD  domain"  early on.
Now,with    platforms    that    don’t
requireGroovy,    like    GitHub,  Azure
DevOpsand  GitLab,  Groovy is losing its
placeat  the  table.
"Groovy  could have
grownfurther  because  it  was the major
script-basedalternative      for    Java
runningon    the    same  JVM.  However,
Kotlinis    taking  over  that  position
rightnow,  so  I  think Groovy will have
ahard   time,"  Jensen  said.
The  TIOBE
indexmay  not  be full of surprises this
month,but  Jansen  did have a lot to say
aboutthe  index  itself  this  month, as
thisis   the  first  time  it  has  been
compiledusing    Similarweb's    traffic
analysisplatform  instead  of Alexa.
"We
haveused  Similarweb  for the first time
thismonth  to  select search engines and
fortunately,there  are  no  big  changes
inthe  index  due to this swap. The only
strikingdifference  is  that  the  top 3
languages,Python,    C,  and  Java,  all
gainedmore    than   1  percent  in  the
rankings,"Jansen    said.
TIOBE  decided
tomake   the  switch  this  month  after
Amazon'sannouncement  in  December  2021
thatit    was  shutting  the  Alexa  web
rankingservice  down,  effective  May 1,
2022,ending     25    years    of    the
program.
Jansennoted    that  not  every
websitehas   been  onboarded,  but  that
theswitch    to  Similarweb  included  a
switchto  using  HtmlUnit, a non-GUI web
browserwith  APIs  that  let  Java  apps
invokepages,  fill  forms  and  do other
standardweb    browsing  activity.  This
switchwill  eventually  allow  TIOBE  to
includewebsites  it  was unable to crawl
before,like  Stackoverflfow  and Github,
