The  February  TIOBE  Index  of the
mostpopular  programming  languages
isout,  and  while  the  work going
onin    the   background  of  TIOBE
calculationshas  changed,  not much
hasshifted    in    the    way   of
rankings.
Pythoncontinues   to  sit
atopthe  index,  with  C  and  Java
directlybehind  it.  In  Feb. 2021,
thosethree  also  occupied  the top
spot,but    with    Python  in  the
numberthree  position,  C  at  top,
andJava   in  second  place.
Beyond
thetop  three,  there hasn’t been
muchmovement  in  the  index,  with
positionsfour      through    eight
unchangedfrom  the  same  time last
year.Those    slots  are  occupied,
respectively,by   C++,  C#,  Visual
Basic,JavaScript        and    PHP.
Positionsnine  and  10 swapped from
Feb.21    to   now,  with  Assembly
Languageand    SQL   now  occupying
eachother's    positions.
The   one
bigmove  of  note between Feb. 2021
andFeb.  2022  was  with the Groovy
programminglanguage,             an
object-orientedlanguage  for  Java.
Overthe    course    of  the  year,
Groovyfell  from  12th position all
theway    to    20th,   putting  it
perilouslyclose    to   the  "other
programminglanguages"   list.
TIOBE
CEOPaul        Jansen    attributes
Groovy'sdecline  to  the  growth in
theCI/CD   space.  Groovy  was  the
onlylanguage    used   for  writing
scriptson   Jenkins,  which  Jansen
describesas  having  been "the only
realplayer  in  the  CI/CD  domain"
earlyon.  Now,  with platforms that
don’trequire      Groovy,    like
GitHub,Azure   DevOps  and  GitLab,
Groovyis  losing  its  place at the
table.
"Groovycould    have   grown
furtherbecause  it  was  the  major
script-basedalternative   for  Java
runningon  the  same  JVM. However,
Kotlinis     taking    over    that
positionright    now,  so  I  think
Groovywill    have  a  hard  time,"
Jensensaid.
The   TIOBE  index  may
notbe    full   of  surprises  this
month,but  Jansen  did  have  a lot
tosay  about  the index itself this
month,as  this  is  the  first time
ithas     been    compiled    using
Similarweb'straffic        analysis
platforminstead    of    Alexa.
"We
haveused  Similarweb  for the first
timethis  month  to  select  search
enginesand  fortunately,  there are
nobig  changes  in the index due to
thisswap.    The    only   striking
differenceis    that    the  top  3
languages,Python,    C,  and  Java,
allgained  more  than  1 percent in
therankings,"   Jansen  said.
TIOBE
decidedto   make  the  switch  this
monthafter   Amazon's  announcement
inDecember    2021    that  it  was
shuttingthe    Alexa   web  ranking
servicedown,    effective   May  1,
2022,ending    25    years  of  the
program.
Jansennoted    that    not
everywebsite  has  been  onboarded,
butthat  the  switch  to Similarweb
includeda     switch    to    using
HtmlUnit,a    non-GUI  web  browser
withAPIs    that    let  Java  apps
invokepages,   fill  forms  and  do
otherstandard       web    browsing
activity.This        switch    will
eventuallyallow  TIOBE  to  include
websitesit   was  unable  to  crawl
before,like    Stackoverflfow   and
Github,which  could  have  a larger
